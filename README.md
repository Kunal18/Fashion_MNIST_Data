# Fashion_MNIST_Data

Implemented a CNN using keras based autoencoder and used it to build a classification model which identified 10 clothing
categories on Fashion MNIST dataset achieving a model accuracy of 92%.

We can see that the training and validation loss are in sync. 
The validation loss decreases which indicates that model is not overfitting. The model's generalization capabity is good.
